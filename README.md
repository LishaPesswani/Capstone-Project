## Capstone Project: Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

## Problem Statement
Financial fraud poses a significant threat to the integrity of financial systems worldwide. Detecting fraudulent activities in financial transactions is crucial for preventing losses and maintaining trust among users. The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions based on various features present in the dataset.

## Data
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains transactional data including information such as transaction type, amount, balance changes, and whether the transaction is flagged as fraudulent or not. The dataset also includes additional features that could potentially be useful for predicting fraudulent transactions.

## Approach
## Data Preprocessing
The dataset is loaded into a pandas data frame.
Null values are checked and handled appropriately.
Categorical variables are converted into a numerical format for model training.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The distribution of different transaction types is visualized to understand the composition of the dataset.
The correlation between different features and the target variable (fraudulent transactions) is analyzed using a correlation matrix.

## Model Development
The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
Imbalanced data is handled using the RandomOverSampler technique to mitigate the class imbalance problem.
Feature scaling is applied to standardize the features.
Two machine learning models are trained: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree.
The models are evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation is also performed to assess model performance across different folds.
Confusion matrices and ROC curves are plotted to visualize model performance.

## Feature Importance
The importance of features in predicting fraudulent transactions is analyzed using the Decision Tree model's feature importance.

## Model Optimization
The Random Forest classifier is implemented and evaluated to potentially improve model performance.
Hyperparameter tuning is conducted using GridSearchCV to find the best combination of parameters for the GradientBoostingClassifier.
Results
Both Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models show promising results in detecting fraudulent transactions.
The Decision Tree model indicates that features related to transaction type, amount, and balance changes are significant in identifying fraud.
The Random Forest classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier are tested for potential improvement in model performance.

## Next Steps
Further exploration of feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
Experimentation with advanced machine learning algorithms such as neural networks.
Continuous monitoring and updating of the model to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.

## Conclusion
The capstone project successfully addresses the challenge of fraud detection in financial transactions using machine learning techniques. By leveraging the dataset and implementing various models, the project demonstrates the potential to develop robust fraud detection systems that can aid financial institutions in protecting against fraudulent activities. Further refinement and experimentation with different approaches can lead to even more accurate and efficient fraud detection models.
