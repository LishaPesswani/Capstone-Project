# Capstone Project - Fraud detection for online payments

## Project Overview

This project aims to leverage a variety of classification algorithms to build an effective fraud detection system, considering both traditional and advanced machine learning techniques. The focus on feature engineering, data preprocessing, and thorough model evaluation will contribute to the development of a robust and accurate fraud detection model.

## Data Loading and Exploration:
1) Load the dataset using a tool like pandas.
2) Explore the dataset to understand its structure, and summary statistics, and identify potential challenges such as missing values or outliers.

## Data Preprocessing:
1) Normalize numerical features.
2) One-hot encodes categorical variables.

## Imbalanced Data Handling:
1) Checked the class distribution to identify any imbalance.
2) Use techniques like oversampling to handle imbalanced data.

## Train-Test Split:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Model Selection:
Choose classification algorithms for your problem. You mentioned logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks.
Train these models on the training set.

## Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the models on the testing set using metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.
Identify the best-performing model.

## Feature Importance Analysis:
For tree-based models (decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting), analyze feature importance to understand which features contribute most to fraud prediction.

## Expected Deliverables:
1) Trained models for fraud detection.
2) Evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1 score, AUC-ROC) for each model.
3) Visualizations of key features and their importance.
